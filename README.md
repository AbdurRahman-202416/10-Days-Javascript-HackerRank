## 🛠️ Key Learnings

Over these 10 days, I have mastered:

- **Days 0-2:** Variable declarations (`let`, `const`), Data Types, Arithmetic Operators, and Control Flow (If-Else, Switch).
- **Days 3-4:** Arrays, Objects, and robust Exception Handling using `try-catch-finally`.
- **Days 5-6:** Modern JavaScript features like **Arrow Functions**, Class Inheritance, and Bitwise Operators.
- **Days 7-8:** Regular Expressions (RegEx) for pattern matching and Date objects.
- **Days 9-10:** Practical projects involving **DOM Manipulation**, including creating buttons and a Binary Calculator.
